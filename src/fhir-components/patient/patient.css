/*
A mixin to generate the classes for one phase of a React CSSTransition.
`$phase` must be `appear` or `enter` or `exit`.
If `enter` phase is given then `appear` phase will be generated at the same time.
If `exit` phase is given then property values are animated in reverse, from final to initial.
**Example:**
@include react-transition-phase(toast, enter, $enter-translate, $before: "&");
@include react-transition-phase(toast, leave, $leave-blur, $pt-transition-duration * 3, $before: "&");
*/
/*
Given map of properties to values, set each property to the value at the given index.
(remember that sass indices are 1-based).
Example: `each-prop((opacity: 0 1), 2)` will print "opacity: 1"
*/
/*
Format transition class name with all the bits.
"enter" phase will include "appear" phase in returned name.
